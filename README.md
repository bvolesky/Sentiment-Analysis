# Logistic Regression Sentiment Analysis ðŸš€

![Good](/assets/images/good.png)

## Project Overview
This project leverages logistic regression to classify sentiments in product reviews to enhance business understanding of customer attitudes. 
  
My model achieves around `91%` accuracy, a notable accomplishment given the complexity of language.

## Learnings and Challenges
This project enhanced my skills in machine learning and data preprocessing. I gained valuable experience in UI/UX design during front-end implementation. Learning about containerization and Docker was pivotal for managing dependencies and developing scalable, lightweight, and robust applications that are OS agnostic.
